Suggest two non-functional tests that you would design
Suggest a framework that could be used to automate the non-functional test above.

The requirements are mainly Functional Testing by passing GET requests and veritying different responses. So I would try to do some Performance Testing and ADA testing. 
  For Performance testing I know we can use Jmeter, we will pass a lot of call in should amount of time to try to overload the system and stress test it.
    We can also pass request and check for CPU usage to see how it performs.
  
  For ADA testing we can do it manually, or use different tools like WAVE, CCA
